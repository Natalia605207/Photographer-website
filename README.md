## Description

The project shows a possible variant of a photographer website. You can see a responsive fixed top navbar, a couple of carousels with the photographer's works, a section with provided services, prices section, a banner, testimonials and a footer with contact info.

***The purpose of this project** was to train my skills in **Bootstrap** by using different elements and customizing them according to the necessary design.

Moreover, I also practiced AOS (Animated On Scroll Library) **to animate images and words**.
